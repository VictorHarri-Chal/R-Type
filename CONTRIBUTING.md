* The title of the commit must start by three letters describing the nature of the commit surrond by []

* - Bug Fix [FIX]

* - Refacto [REF]

* - Adding of a functionnality [ADD]

* - Conflicts fix [MER]

* Prefer putting detailed informations inside the commit's description.

* Example:
  ```sh
  $> git commit -m '[FIX] infinite loop when pressing Alt-F4

  This was caused by a missing check in the event loop
  The program now checks when the window is set to close'
  ```
